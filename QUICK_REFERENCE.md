   - Temporarily disable
   - Our proxy should work anyway

2. **Deployment issue**
   - Check serverless functions deployed
   - Verify API routes work

3. **Network/firewall**
   - Test: `curl -I https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/10/301/384.png`
   - May need to allow external requests
