# Tile Providers - Why Not Google Maps?

## TL;DR

**Q: "Cosa comporta se usiamo Google Maps?" (What would happen if we use Google Maps?)**

**A:** Google Maps would require:
- ❌ API key (requires credit card)
- ❌ $7 per 1000 map loads ($200-$300/month for typical usage)
- ❌ Complex billing setup
- ❌ Usage limits and quotas

**Current solution (CARTO + OpenStreetMap) is better:**
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No API key required
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Works reliably on Vercel/Netlify/Railway
- ✅ Same map quality

## Detailed Comparison

### Current Solution: CARTO + OpenStreetMap

#### CARTO (Primary)
- **Cost:** FREE (no API key needed)
- **Quality:** Uses OpenStreetMap data (high quality)
- **Reliability:** Production-ready, handles high traffic
- **Speed:** Fast global CDN
- **Limitations:** None for typical usage
- **Setup:** Zero configuration needed

#### OpenStreetMap (Fallback)
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Quality:** Community-maintained, excellent coverage
- **Reliability:** Good for fallback
- **Limitations:** Rate-limited for high-traffic sites (that's why we use CARTO as primary)

### Google Maps Alternative

#### Costs
- **Map loads:** $7 per 1000 loads
- **Static maps:** $2 per 1000 requests
- **Free tier:** $200/month credit (but requires credit card)

#### Typical monthly costs for this app:
- 10,000 users/month = ~$70-$140/month
- 50,000 users/month = ~$350-$700/month
- 100,000 users/month = ~$700-$1,400/month

#### Technical requirements:
1. Google Cloud Platform account
2. Enable Maps JavaScript API
3. Enable Billing (credit card required)
4. Create API key
5. Restrict API key to prevent unauthorized use
6. Monitor usage to avoid surprise bills
7. Handle rate limiting
8. Implement error handling for quota exceeded

#### Legal requirements:
- Display Google logo and terms
- Cannot cache tiles
- Must use official Google Maps JavaScript API
- Cannot use tiles outside their API

### Other Alternatives Considered

#### Mapbox
- **Cost:** FREE tier: 50,000 loads/month, then $0.50 per 1000
- **Quality:** Excellent
- **Requires:** API key
- **Why not?** Requires API key management, costs after free tier

#### Bing Maps
- **Cost:** FREE tier exists, then paid
- **Quality:** Good
- **Requires:** API key
- **Why not?** API key required, less reliable than CARTO

#### Stamen
- **Cost:** FREE
- **Quality:** Artistic styles
- **Why not?** Hosted on CloudFlare, can be blocked in some regions

#### Thunderforest
- **Cost:** FREE tier: 150,000 tiles/month
- **Requires:** API key
- **Why not?** API key required

## Common Questions

### Q: Why isn't the map working?

**Quick Diagnostic:** Run `./test-tile-providers.sh` to automatically test tile provider connectivity.

If the map isn't displaying, try:

1. **Check internet connection**
   ```bash
   # Test if CARTO is accessible
   curl -I https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/10/301/384.png
   ```

2. **Check browser console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for tile loading errors
   - Check if `/api/tiles/` requests are failing

3. **Disable ad-blockers temporarily**
   - Although our proxy should work with ad-blockers, some aggressive ones might block it

4. **Check Vercel/Netlify deployment**
   - Verify serverless functions are deployed
   - Check function logs for errors
   - Ensure no CORS issues

5. **Test the tile proxy directly**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/tiles/10/301/384.png
   ```

### Q: Is CARTO reliable for production?

**Yes!** CARTO is specifically designed for production use:
- Used by major organizations and companies
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Global CDN infrastructure
- Handles millions of tile requests
- Free tier has no published limits for web applications

### Q: What if CARTO goes down?

Our implementation has **automatic fallback**:
1. First tries CARTO (fastest, most reliable)
2. If CARTO fails, tries OpenStreetMap
3. If both fail, shows error

This redundancy ensures the map works even if one provider has issues.

### Q: Can I add Google Maps as an option?

Technically yes, but **not recommended** because:
1. **Costs:** Would need to charge users or limit usage
2. **Complexity:** Requires API key management and billing
3. **Unnecessary:** Current solution works great
4. **Legal:** Google's terms require using their official SDK, not direct tile access

If you really need Google Maps for a private deployment:
1. Fork the project
2. Set up Google Cloud Platform billing
3. Implement Google Maps JavaScript API properly (not tiles)
4. Handle all the complexity and costs

### Q: Why not use multiple free providers?

We do! The current setup uses:
- **Primary:** CARTO (production-ready, fast)
- **Fallback:** OpenStreetMap (community-supported)

This gives us redundancy without complexity.

### Q: How can I verify which tiles are loading?

Check the browser console or server logs:
```javascript
// In browser console:
// Look for messages like:
// "Loaded tile from CARTO: 10/301/384"
// "Failed to fetch from CARTO, trying next provider..."
```

Or check network tab in Developer Tools:
- Look for requests to `/api/tiles/`
- Check response status (200 = success)
- Check response size (should be ~5-50KB per tile)

## Technical Details

### How Tile Servers Work

```
User Browser
    ↓
    ↓ Requests tile: /api/tiles/10/301/384.png
    ↓
Our Server (server.js)
    ↓
    ↓ 1. Try CARTO
    ↓    https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager/10/301/384.png
    ↓
    ↓ If fails:
    ↓
    ↓ 2. Try OpenStreetMap
    ↓    https://tile.openstreetmap.org/10/301/384.png
    ↓
    ↓ Return PNG tile
    ↓
User Browser (displays tile)
```

### Tile Coordinate System

- **Zoom levels:** 0 (whole world) to 18 (street level)
- **Tile size:** 256×256 pixels
- **Format:** PNG (supports transparency)
- **Projection:** Web Mercator (EPSG:3857)

At zoom level Z:
- Number of tiles: 2^Z × 2^Z
- Tile X: 0 to 2^Z - 1 (west to east)
- Tile Y: 0 to 2^Z - 1 (north to south)

Example for zoom 10:
- Total tiles: 1024 × 1024 = 1,048,576 tiles
- Each tile covers ~40km × 40km (at equator)

### Caching Strategy

```javascript
// Browser caches tiles in memory
const tileCache = new Map();

// Server sets cache headers
res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=86400'); // 24 hours

// CARTO's CDN caches tiles globally
// Result: Super fast loading, minimal bandwidth
```

## If You Really Need Google Maps

⚠️ **Warning:** Only do this if you have a specific requirement and budget.

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Google Cloud Platform account**
   - Visit https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Add billing information (credit card required)

2. **Enable APIs**
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API (if needed)

3. **Create API Key**
   - Restrict to your domain
   - Set usage quotas

4. **Modify the code** (not trivial)
   - Cannot use tile proxy approach
   - Must use Google Maps JavaScript API
   - Requires frontend rewrite
   - Must handle billing/quotas

5. **Monitor costs**
   - Set up budget alerts
   - Monitor usage daily
   - Implement usage caps

### Estimated Implementation Time
- Setup: 1-2 hours
- Code changes: 4-8 hours
- Testing: 2-4 hours
- Monitoring setup: 1-2 hours
- **Total: 8-16 hours of work**

### Annual Cost Estimate
For 50,000 monthly users:
- Map loads: $350-$700/month
- **Annual: $4,200-$8,400/year**

Compare to CARTO + OSM: **$0/year**

## Conclusion

**Question:** "Cosa comporta se usiamo Google Maps?"

**Answer:** Google Maps would add:
- Significant costs ($4,000-$8,000+ per year)
- Complex setup and maintenance
- Privacy concerns (Google tracking)
- Vendor lock-in
- No real benefits over current solution

**Recommendation:** Stick with CARTO + OpenStreetMap
- It's free, fast, and reliable
- Zero configuration or maintenance
- Better for open-source projects
- Same map quality

**If map isn't working:** Debug the current setup first! Usually it's:
- Deployment issue (functions not deployed)
- Network issue (firewall/corporate proxy)
- Browser issue (aggressive ad-blocker)

These are easier to fix than switching to Google Maps.
